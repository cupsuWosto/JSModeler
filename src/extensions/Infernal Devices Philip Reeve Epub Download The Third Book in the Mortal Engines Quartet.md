## What is Infernal Devices about?
 
Infernal Devices is the third book in the Mortal Engines Quartet by Philip Reeve, a dystopian steampunk adventure that follows the exploits of Tom and Hester, two fugitives who live in a world where cities are mobile and prey on each other. In this installment, they have to face old enemies and new dangers as they try to rescue their daughter Wren, who has been kidnapped by a mysterious cult.
 
The story begins with Wren, who is bored with her life in Anchorage-in-Vineland, a static settlement on an island in North America. She longs for adventure and excitement, and when a charming submarine pirate named Gargle offers her a chance to escape, she agrees to steal a mysterious Tin Book from her parents' library. The Tin Book contains secrets that could change the course of the war between the Traction Cities and the Green Storm, a fanatical anti-tractionist faction led by the Stalker Fang, a resurrected cyborg version of the legendary Anna Fang.
 
Wren's theft sets off a chain of events that leads her parents, Tom and Hester, back into the fray. They join forces with their old friend Professor Nimrod Pennyroyal, a notorious liar and adventurer who is now the mayor of Brighton, a floating resort city. Together, they pursue Gargle and his submarine across the oceans, hoping to find Wren before it's too late. Along the way, they encounter old foes such as Uncle, the leader of the Lost Boys, a band of scavengers and thieves; Fishcake, a young Lost Boy who befriends Wren; and Oenone Zero, a former Green Storm agent who has a personal vendetta against Hester.
 
## Why should you read Infernal Devices?
 
Infernal Devices is a fast-paced and action-packed novel that will keep you on the edge of your seat. It is full of twists and turns, surprises and shocks, humor and horror. It explores themes such as family, loyalty, identity, revenge, and redemption. It also expands on the rich and imaginative world that Reeve has created in his previous books, introducing new characters, places, and technologies.
 
If you are a fan of steampunk, science fiction, fantasy, or adventure genres, you will enjoy Infernal Devices. It is a book that can appeal to both young and adult readers alike. It is also a book that can stand on its own, but it is recommended that you read the first two books in the series, Mortal Engines and Predator's Gold, before diving into this one. You will appreciate the depth and complexity of the story and the characters more if you do so.
