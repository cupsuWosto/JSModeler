## What is Stroke Scribe ActiveX?
  
Stroke Scribe ActiveX is an event-driven, asynchronous serial port interface control that works with physical RS232 and RS485 ports, USB-to-Serial bridges, and serial port emulators. It has a practically unlimited serial data buffering capability and supports both binary arrays and text strings. It also allows you to programmatically control the DTR/RTS pins and access the DSR/CTS pin states. Moreover, it can automatically reconnect with USB serial devices upon attachment.
  
## How to Download and Install Stroke Scribe ActiveX?
  
You can download the demo or buy a license of Stroke Scribe ActiveX from [this link](https://strokescribe.com/en/serial-port-download.html). The setup program contains both x86 and x64 versions of the control and is compatible with Windows 2000, XP, Vista, 7, 8/8.1, 10, and Server 2003/2008. The demo version is free for testing purposes but will sometimes show a message about its "Demo" status. The single user license costs $20 and allows you to use the software on one computer. The developer license costs $60 and grants you the right to redistribute the software as an integral part of your custom developed products.
  
## How to Use Stroke Scribe ActiveX in Your Projects?
  
To use Stroke Scribe ActiveX in your projects, you need to add a reference to the control in your development environment. For example, if you are using Visual Basic 6, you can go to Project > References and check the box for StrokeReader ActiveX Library. Then, you can drag and drop the StrokeReader control from the toolbox onto your form. You can also create an instance of the control programmatically using the CreateObject function.
  
Once you have an instance of the control, you can set its properties and call its methods to communicate with your serial port device. For example, you can use the PortName property to specify the name of the serial port (such as "COM1"), the BaudRate property to set the data transmission speed (such as 9600), and the Open method to open the port. You can also use the Write method to send data to the device and handle the DataReceived event to receive data from the device.

## Conclusion
  
Stroke Scribe ActiveX is a versatile and reliable control that enables you to interface with various serial port devices in your custom projects. It offers a simple and intuitive way to send and receive data asynchronously and handle different types of serial communication scenarios. You can download the demo or buy a license of Stroke Scribe ActiveX from [this link](https://strokescribe.com/en/serial-port-download.html) and start using it in your projects today.
