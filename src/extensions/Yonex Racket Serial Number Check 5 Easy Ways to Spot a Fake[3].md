## What is a Serial Number?
 
A serial number is a unique code that identifies a specific product. Yonex rackets have two serial numbers: one on the shaft and one on the cone. The shaft serial number is located just above the cone, while the cone serial number is located below the handle, under the grip. You may need to peel away the grip to see it.
 
## How to Read the Serial Number?
 
The serial number on the shaft consists of a series of digits that indicate various information about the racket. The first five digits refer to the date of production, in DDMMY format. For example, 13092 means 13 September 2012. The sixth digit is a manufacturing code that varies depending on the model and region. The last two letters indicate the country code, such as UK, SP, JP, CH, KR, etc.
 
The serial number on the cone also has a similar format, but with some differences. The first five digits are still the date of production, but in DDMYY format. For example, 13092 means 13 September 2012. The sixth digit is a letter that indicates the region code, such as A for Asia, E for Europe, U for USA, etc. The last two digits are numbers that indicate the batch number.

## How to Check if the Serial Number is Genuine?
 
There are several ways to check if the serial number of your Yonex racket is genuine or not. Here are some tips:
 
- Check if the serial number is laser engraved or printed. Genuine Yonex rackets have laser engraved serial numbers on both the shaft and the cone, while counterfeit rackets may have printed serial numbers that can be easily rubbed off.
- Check if the serial number matches with the model and year of release. You can do some research online or contact Yonex representatives to find out when a certain model was launched and what region it was marketed for. For example, if you have a Nanoray Z Speed racket with a UK code on the shaft, it should have been produced in 2013 or later.
- Check if the serial number matches with the hologram sticker on the cone. Genuine Yonex rackets have a hologram sticker on the cone that changes color when viewed from different angles. The hologram sticker should have a matching serial number with the one on the cone.

## Conclusion
 
Checking the serial number of your Yonex racket is one of the ways to ensure that you have a genuine product that meets your expectations and performance. However, it is not foolproof and there may be other factors to consider, such as the quality of materials, design, weight, balance, etc. Therefore, it is always advisable to buy your Yonex racket from an authorized dealer or retailer that can guarantee its authenticity and warranty.
