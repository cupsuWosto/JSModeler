The Asus Eee PC 900HD Recovery CD is a disc that contains the original software and drivers that came with your laptop when you bought it. It can help you reinstall Windows XP, restore your system settings, and recover your data. However, you may not have the recovery CD with you, or you may have lost or damaged it. Fortunately, you can download the recovery CD from the official Asus website and burn it to a blank disc.
 
In this article, we will show you how to download and use the Asus Eee PC 900HD Recovery CD to restore your laptop to its original state. Follow these steps carefully and make sure you have a stable internet connection and a blank CD-R or CD-RW disc.
 
## Step 1: Download the Recovery CD
 
To download the recovery CD, you need to visit the Asus support website[^1^] and find your laptop model. You can do this by typing "Eee PC 900HD/XP" in the search box and clicking on the result. Alternatively, you can use the download center[^2^] and select your product category, series, and model from the drop-down menus.
 
Once you find your laptop model, you will see a list of drivers and tools for different operating systems. Choose Windows XP as your operating system and scroll down to find the recovery CD file. The file name is "Eee PC 900HD/XP Support DVD Rev 1.2". Click on the download button and save the file to your computer. The file size is about 3.5 GB, so it may take some time to download depending on your internet speed.
 
## Step 2: Burn the Recovery CD
 
After downloading the recovery CD file, you need to burn it to a blank disc using a CD burner software. You can use any software that supports ISO files, such as Nero, ImgBurn, or CDBurnerXP. Insert a blank CD-R or CD-RW disc into your CD drive and launch the software. Select the option to burn an image file to a disc and browse for the recovery CD file that you downloaded. Choose a low burning speed (such as 4x or 8x) to avoid errors and click on the burn button. Wait for the process to complete and eject the disc when it is done.
 
## Step 3: Use the Recovery CD
 
Now that you have the recovery CD ready, you can use it to restore your laptop. Make sure you back up any important data that you want to keep before proceeding, as this process will erase everything on your hard drive. Plug in your laptop's power adapter and insert the recovery CD into your CD drive. Turn on your laptop and press F2 repeatedly to enter the BIOS setup menu. Use the arrow keys to navigate to the Boot tab and change the boot order so that your CD drive is the first option. Press F10 to save and exit.
 
Your laptop will reboot and load the recovery CD. Follow the on-screen instructions to select your language, accept the license agreement, and choose your recovery option. You can either perform a full system recovery or a partial system recovery. A full system recovery will erase everything on your hard drive and reinstall Windows XP and all the original software and drivers. A partial system recovery will only erase your C: drive and reinstall Windows XP, leaving your D: drive intact.
