# Jawset TurbulenceFD: A Powerful Tool for Creating Realistic Fluid Simulations
 
Jawset TurbulenceFD is a plugin for Cinema 4D that allows you to create stunning gaseous fluid effects such as fire, smoke, explosions, clouds and dust. It uses a voxel-based solver based on the incompressible Navier Stokes equations to simulate the motion and properties of fluids on a grid. You can use any type of geometric object or particle system to paint the sources of smoke, heat, fuel, etc. in space and let the flow carry them along in a physically plausible way. TurbulenceFD also features a realistic fire shader that simulates high dynamic range fire colors based on the Black Body Radiation model. You can design your own color gradients or use the built-in presets for different types of flames.

TurbulenceFD is designed to optimize performance and speed up your workflow. It features a hybrid CPU/GPU simulation pipeline that can achieve up to 12x speedup on the GPU compared to the CPU. It also supports all features at the same quality on both CPU and GPU modes. If you run out of GPU memory, TurbulenceFD can switch back to the CPU on-the-fly without interrupting your simulation. You can also tweak your fluid parameters while the simulation is processing and see the effect of the changes in real-time. This allows you to iterate faster and achieve the desired look more easily.
 
If you want to create realistic and stunning fluid simulations for your Cinema 4D projects, Jawset TurbulenceFD is a plugin you should definitely check out. You can download it from [Jawset's website](https://www.jawset.com/turbulencefd/) or buy it from [CG Persia](https://cgpersia.com/2018/09/jawset-turbulencefd-v1-0-build-1437-r20win-144758.html). The latest version is v1.0 Build 1437 R20 win, which supports Cinema 4D R20 and RealFlow particle emitters.
