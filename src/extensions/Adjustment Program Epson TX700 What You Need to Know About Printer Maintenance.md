## Using a Virtual Machine
 
A virtual machine is a software that allows you to run another operating system inside your current one. For example, you can run Windows 7 32 bit inside your Windows 10 64 bit using a virtual machine. This way, you can install and run Ansys 15 on the virtual machine without affecting your main system. To use a virtual machine, you need to follow these steps:
 
1. Download and install a virtual machine software, such as [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) or [VMware](https://www.vmware.com/).
2. Create a new virtual machine and choose Windows 7 32 bit as the operating system.
3. Allocate enough memory and disk space for the virtual machine.
4. Install Windows 7 32 bit on the virtual machine using an ISO file or a DVD.
5. Download Ansys 15 from [Ansys Student Software](https://www.ansys.com/en-in/academic/students/ansys-student) [^1^] or from [ANSYS Products 2015 Free Download](https://getintopc.com/softwares/3d-cad/ansys-products-2015-free-download/) [^2^].
6. Install Ansys 15 on the virtual machine following the instructions.
7. Launch Ansys 15 from the virtual machine and enjoy.

## Using a Remote Desktop
 
A remote desktop is a software that allows you to access another computer over the internet. For example, you can access your university computer from your home computer using a remote desktop. This way, you can use Ansys 15 on the university computer without installing it on your own computer. To use a remote desktop, you need to follow these steps:

1. Check if your university provides Windows Remote Desktop or some other remote software and get the login credentials.
2. Download and install a remote desktop software, such as [Chrome Remote Desktop](https://remotedesktop.google.com/) or [TeamViewer](https://www.teamviewer.com/).
3. Connect to your university computer using the remote desktop software and the login credentials.
4. Launch Ansys 15 from the university computer and enjoy.

## Conclusion
 
Ansys 15 is a great simulation software for engineering students and professionals, but it is not compatible with Windows 10 64 bit. However, you can still use it on your Windows 10 64 bit computer by using either a virtual machine or a remote desktop. Both methods have their advantages and disadvantages, so you can choose the one that suits you best. We hope this article was helpful for you.
